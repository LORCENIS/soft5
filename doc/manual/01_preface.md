# Preface

SOFT5 is a toolkit for building scientific software. SOFT5 allows for
data to be formally described at a very low level. These descriptions
are used to instruct computers how data should be interpreted or
transformed. By sharing these formal descriptions, SOFT5 allows for
the coupling of software by allowing one application to read data
written by another, without having to care about how the data
represenation such as file formats etc.

Many ideas of SOFT5 aligns with the concepts of Linked Open Data and
the semantic web, however SOFT5 sacrifises the richness and dynamic
flexibility of the Resource Description Framework (RDF) with a
pragmatic and minimalistic approach that is suitable for representing
data and "state" in scientific software, and related this to
persistant storage.

## Scope of this manual

This manual gives a brief introduction to the fundaments of SOFT5. In
Chapter [?] Porto and NanoSim is presented. The last 3 chapters
are dedicated to UseCases in NanoSim where SOFT/Porto is used to handle
interoperability between different simulation tools.
