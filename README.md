Common Environment Software Platform for Multiscale Modelling
-------------------------------------------------------------

The Porto platform, based on SOFT (SINTEF Open Framework and Tools) will provide a lightweight and flexible system for data and workflow management. The prevalent way of working with multi-scale model development is not data-agnostic. This complicates the adoption of new software and various workflows, as data has to be fitted to every transitional phase. Existing systems that do embrace unified access to the data are often relying on predefined schemas. Porto will overcome these limitations by adopting technology from exemplary projects, tailored to fit the needs of the NanoSim project. The key benefit of the unified data access is the ability for offline-analysis of big amounts of data by different research groups all over the world. Data from one simulation can be used by various researchers to generate new model formulations, effectively removing the need for redundant simulations of the same problem. In addition, the seamless integration of statistical analysis tools will significantly speed up the model development process, which is currently a tedious and cumbersome task.
