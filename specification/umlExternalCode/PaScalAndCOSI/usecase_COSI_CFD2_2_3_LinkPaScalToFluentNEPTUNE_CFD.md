| Use Case Name                       | Perform a CFDEM simulation using an ANSYS Fluent Mesh     |
| Scope                               | Import an ANSYS Fluent mesh, and run a CFDEM simulation  |
| Level                               | End Usage                          |
| Primary Actor                       | Engineers in industry (former ANSYS Fluent customers)    |
| Stakeholders and Interests          | Engineers and researchers that use CFDEM for predictive simulations in complex geometries |
| Preconditions                       | Physical and chemical data, boundary conditions, as well as Fluent msh or cas file available |
| Success Guarantee                   | Import and subsequent simulation completes without error, results are insensitive to numerical settings
| Main Success Scenario               | Simulation results match ANSYS Fluent results within error limits   |
| Extensions                          | Large deviation to ANSYS Fluent simulation results  |
